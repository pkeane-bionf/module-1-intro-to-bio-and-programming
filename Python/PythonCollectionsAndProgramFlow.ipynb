    "To start using lists, let's begin by creating some. Can you:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create an empty list called `mylist1`\n",
    "* Create a list called `mylist2` with the numbers from 0 to 9 in order in it\n",

    "### Important Info\n",
    "* To create a copy of a list, use the `list(...)` function, e.g.:\n",
    "```\n",
    "In [1]: mylist = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",

    "* Write a loop that prints out each character of the `mystr` variable below\n",
    "* Write a loop that stores the values of the 7 times table from 0 to 70 in a list variable `seven_list`. The `range` function will be useful here!\n",

    "    - To help with this, you can use nested loops to create the two dimensional structure of the matrix\n",
    "    - Use the `range` function in both loops to go from 0 -> 9\n",
    "    - Create an empty list initially, then in the first loop add an empty list to it and finally in the inner loop append the value to this list, e.g. `mymat2[x].append(10 * x + y + 1)`\n",
