    "This notebook is designed to reinforce the concepts introduced in Lesson 3 of Unit 3 of the Biology and Computation course. It's primary focus is to give you some experience with debugging code. There are a number of code examples supplied that have different types of error in them. The code will cover the folowing types of error:\n",
