    "\n",
    "* `dna1`, `dna2`, `dna3`: These functions take no arguments and return 3 different DNA sequences\n",
    "* `generate_dna_sequence(...)`: This function takes an integer and returns a random DNA string with this number of bases\n",
    "* `dna_analyser_v1(...)`: Version 1 of a DNA analyser function that takes a DNA string and performs some analysis\n",
    "* `dna_analyser_v2(...)`: Version 2 of a DNA analyser function that takes a DNA string and performs some analysis\n",
    "* `get_time()`: Returns the current number of seconds after an arbitrary point (1st Jan, 1970 if you're interested!)\n",
    "* `dna_experiment_output()`: Produces some DNA data as if produced by an experiment.\n"

    "## Exercise 1:  Manipulating DNA Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "DNA consists of sequences of four bases represented by the letters A, C, G and T. In Python, this is most easily represented by a string of these letters. This first exercise is going to get you to use external functions and string manipulation routines to do some analysis on some DNA strings. Note that at the moment you'll need to use some copy and paste of the code but don't worry - we'll learn techniques to avoid that later in the course!\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create 3 variables that contain the DNA strings returned by the functions `dna1`, `dna2` and `dna3`\n",
    "* Find the length of all the sequences\n",
    "* Combine the shortest two sequences into a new sequence\n",
    "* Find the number of each type of base in the longest sequence\n",
    "* One of the DNA strings is included in one of the others. Find the base number (index) where this sub-sequence occurs\n",
    "\n",
    "After this, please fill in the cell underneath with the answers and run it to check if you've got it right!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Info\n",
    "* To find the length of a string or collection, use the `len()` function, e.g.:\n",
    "```\n",
    "In [1]: len(\"test\")\n",
    "Out[1]: 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "* To combine strings you can just add them together:\n",
    "```\n",
    "In [1]: \"abc\" + \"def\"\n",
    "Out[1]: 'abcdef'\n",
    "```\n",
    "* You can find the number of times a character or substring occurs in a string using `string.count(...)`, e.g.\n",
    "```\n",
    "In [1]: mystr = \"my testing string\"\n",
    "In [2]: mystr.count(\"i\")\n",
    "Out[2]: 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "* To find the index a substring occurs in another string use `string.find(...)`, e.g.\n",
    "```\n",
    "In [1]: mystr = \"my testing string\"\n",
    "In [2]: mystr.find(\"ing\")\n",
    "Out[2]: 7\n",

You will find that as you scale up to larger datasets, you may start hitting efficiency problems or your chosen algorithm doesn't work as well as it did with smaller datasets. It's good to approach these kinds of issues in a systematic way to find out where the bottlenecks are. You then know where to concentrate on optimising the code or the algorithm.\n",
