This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. 
When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

#In this notebook, you will analyse the cell wall data you processed in the Linux and Python steps of the pipeline.

Your Task
Work through the code chunks in the following notebook to read in and analyse your processed data on the abundance of cell wall components.

Follow the instructions for each code chunk, adding code where specified and using the exact variable names supplied. 
You can add your own additional code chunks as needed to gain further practice as you work through the notebook.

```{r}
#run this cell to clear R's brain, always a good first step in any notebook you write
rm(list=ls())
```

First, run the following chunk to load the necessary libraries.

```{r}
#run this cell to load the necessary libraries
library(assertthat)
library(stringr)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
#specify this to enable plotting to work
options(bitmapType='cairo')
library(assertthat)
library(stringr)
library(ottr)
```

#Reading in your data

Add code to the chunk below that does the following:
* Reads in the data file you created using Python called `data.reformat.csv` and assigns it to a data frame called `cw`
```{r}
#Read in the cell wall data to a data frame called `cw`
################## ADD YOUR CODE UNDER THIS LINE #######

```

```{r}
# Run this chunk to check your answers
. = ottr::check("tests/cw_check_data.R")
```

#Extracting your data into different cell wall components
You are informed that the 17 antibodies in your dataset probe three different kinds of cell wall polysaccharides.
Run the code chunk below to generate a vector of antibody names for each kind of cell wall component.

```{r}
#Run this cell to define the 3 groups of polysaccharides.
pectins <- c("JIM5","JIM7","LM18","LM19","LM8","LM5","LM6")
hemicelluloses <- c("LM21","LM23","LM15","LM24","LM25","LM10","LM11")
glycoproteins <- c("JIM20","LM1","LM2")
```

Add code to the chunk below that does the following:
* Create a data frame called `cw.pectins` containing only the rows for those antibodies in the pectins group.
* Create a data frame called `cw.hemi` containing only the rows for those antibodies in the hemicelluloses group.
* Create a data frame called `cw.glyco` containing only the rows for those antibodies in the glycoproteins group.
* HINT: you can combine dplyr's filter() with use of the %in% function, which returns a Boolean (e.g. "JIM5" %in% pectins returns TRUE).

```{r}
#Create the three data frames for the 3 groups of polysaccharides.
################## ADD YOUR CODE UNDER THIS LINE #######

```

```{r}
# Run this chunk to check your answers
. = ottr::check("tests/cw_glycos.R")
```

#Next, we learn that pectin components can be accurately quantified from the CDTA extraction only.
#Meanwhile, the NaoH extraction works for the hemicellulose or glycoprotein components.

Add code to the chunk below that does the following:
* Extracts only those rows from the `cw.pectins` data frame that contain the CDTA extraction data and name the data frame `cw.pectins.cdta`
* Extracts only those rows from the `cw.hemi` data frame that contain the NaOH extraction data and name the data frame `cw.hemi.naoh`
* Extracts only those rows from the `cw.glyco` data frame that contain the NaOH extraction data and name the data frame `cw.glyco.naoh`

```{r}
#Create three new data frames containing the correct cell wall extraction information
################## ADD YOUR CODE UNDER THIS LINE #######

```

```{r}
# Run this chunk to check your answers
. = ottr::check("tests/cw_glycos_extract.R")
```

#Now that you have some processed data, let's do some plotting.

Add code to the chunk below that does the following:
* Create a box plot of abundance as a function of variety for the pectins data in `cw.pectins.cdta`
```{r}
#Show a box plot of "abundance" as a function of "variety"
################## ADD YOUR CODE UNDER THIS LINE #######

```
From the graph, it doesn't look like to abundance of pectins is very different between varieties, at least not when we consider all the pectin components.

#Let's have a look at the abundance of individual pectin components.

Add code to the chunk below that does the following:
* Plot the abundance values for antibody `LM6` as a function of `variety`. 
* HINT: you can supply ggplot with the filtered `cw.pectins.cdta` data frame using filter().

```{r}
#Show a box plot of abundance values as a function of variety for the antibody `LM6`.
################## ADD YOUR CODE UNDER THIS LINE #######

```

Now this plot looks a lot more interesting. There is a clear difference between varieties in the abundance of the `LM6` component.

#Does component abundance relate to disease resistance?
Next, you want to know if the `LM6` component shows a difference in abundance between varieties that are disease resistant and those that are not.
You are told that the two most resistant varieties are Sarpo Shona and Sarpo Mira. All other varieties show varying degrees of susceptibility.

Add code to the chunk below that does the following:
* Create a new vector called `resistant` containing the values Sarpo Shona and Sarpo Mira (Hint: use c())

```{r}
#Create a new vector called `resistant` containing the values Sarpo Shona and Sarpo Mira
################## ADD YOUR CODE UNDER THIS LINE #######

```

```{r}
# Run this chunk to check your answers
. = ottr::check("tests/cw_resistant.R")
```

Add code to the chunk below that does the following:
* Modify your data frame `cw.pectins.cdta` to include a new column called `Resistant` that contains a boolean value for resistance (TRUE or FALSE) 
* HINT: Combine the use of mutate() and %in%

```{r}
#Modify your data frame `cw.pectins.cdta` to include a new column called `Resistant` that contains a boolean value for resistance
################## ADD YOUR CODE UNDER THIS LINE #######

```

```{r}
# Run this chunk to check your answers
. = ottr::check("tests/cw_resistant_bool.R")
```

To answer our question, now make another box plot to see the distribution of `LM6` abundance by resistance instead of by variety.

```{r}
#Show a box plot of abundance values as a function of resistance for the antibody `LM6`.
################## ADD YOUR CODE UNDER THIS LINE #######

```

Now this plot should indeed look even more interesting! 
Hopefully, you can see that the abundance for `LM6` is very different in the two resistant varieties compared with the others.
In fact, the two boxes do not overlap at all!

#Does component abundance relate to disease resistance in both farming systems?
Now, we might be interested to see whether the same effect can be observed in both farming systems, organic and conventional.

Add code to the chunk below that does the following:
* Use facet_wrap() to create two side by side box plots like the one you made above but for the two farming systems separately.

```{r}
#Show a box plot of abundance values as a function of variety for the antibody LM6.
################## ADD YOUR CODE UNDER THIS LINE #######

```

Hopefully you can see from your box plot that the same pattern is observed in both growing systems, though there might be a bigger difference between the
resistant and susceptible varieties when they are grown in the conventional system. 

Next steps could be to investigate the role of the cell wall component assayed by the `LM6` antibody in disease resistance.

This is the end of the notebook.
